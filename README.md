*Instruction:

Run "ExCleaner.jar" or "ExCleaner.exe".
You should have Java 8 installed!
To clean files you must choose folder. 
After that write an extension and press button "DELETE".
For example, written .exe will delete files, which ends with this extension.

Note! Don't forget to write extension with "." (without "")!

[WARNING] ExCleaner creates log-file, named as "ExCleanerLogs.txt" on Desktop (Windows) or in your USER home directory (Other OS)!
Here you can see a list of deleted files for all time.

Thank you for choosing ExCleaner!

[ToDo] I am going to create a light installer for about 3 weeks to make your life easier :)

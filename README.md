# ExCleaner - Deleting files from your PC by one click!
This is an open-source project, written on language Java 8.

Download Java (if you need it) - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

*Instruction:

Run "ExCleaner.jar" or "ExCleaner.exe".
You should have Java 8 installed!
To clean files you must choose folder. 
After that write an extension and press button "DELETE".
For example, written .exe will delete files, which ends with this extension.

Note! Don't forget to write extension with "." (without "")!

Thank you for choosing ExCleaner!

[ToDo] I am going to create a light installer for about 3 weeks to make your life easier :)
